# 12/12/22 : Fixing IAM token handling logic, because of 
#            refreshToken life-time reduction from 30d to 3d
#
# IAMAuth handler class is used as external authentication for request python lib 
# 
# Each time a HTTP call to the IBM Cloud functions service is done the __call__ 
# method of this class is called. The caller expects to get a valid AUTH-Token as result
# 
# AUTH-TOKEN  is requested from IBM IAM service using the __requestToken() method which 
#             is providing the iamApiKey as input and gets an valid access-token with a 
#             life-time ( currently 1 hour). As long as the access-token is not expired 
#             the last retrieved value is still used. 
#             On __isTokenExpired  a new access-token is requested using the api-key.
#
#    Comment: refresh token usage is removed with the fix of 12/12/22
